This section is based on understanding the principles of object oriented programming(OOP) and write reusable and clean code.

Major java OOP principles are : 

1.  Encapsulation
	Encapsulation is all about wrapping variables and methods in one single unit with the sole purpose of data hiding from external classes.

2. Inheritance
   Inheritance is the OOP ability that allows Java classes to be derived from other classes.

3. Abstraction
   Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details from the user. Only the functionality will be provided to the user.

4. Polymorphism
   Polymorphism in Java allows subclasses of a class to define their own unique behaviors and yet share some of the same functionality of the parent class.
